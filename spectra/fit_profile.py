"""Fit a scanner's device RGB to CIE XYZ, and score the fit honestly.

A matrix-and-curves ICC profile is, underneath, exactly two things: a per
channel tone curve that linearises the device, and a 3x3 that rotates the
linearised device primaries onto CIE XYZ. This fits both from a scanned
chart, in about a hundred lines and with no colour-management stack
installed, and writes the result as JSON that the sampler can apply.

    python -m spectra.fit_profile measured.csv reference.cie -o v600.json

Two numbers come back. The **fit** error is how well the model reproduces the
chart it was fitted to — always flattering, because the chart is both the
question and the answer. The **cross-validated** error refits the matrix with
each patch held out and scores that patch against a model that never saw it;
that is the number that predicts what happens to a colour the chart does not
contain, and it is the one to quote.

This does not replace ArgyllCMS. A cLUT profile fitted by ``colprof`` will
beat a 3x3 on a chart with saturated patches, and only an ICC profile can be
handed to other software. What this gives is a self-contained, tested,
inspectable path from a scan to a defensible Lab number.
